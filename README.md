# Music Genre Classification with PCA

### Introduction
In this music genre classification project, I work with a dataset containing various musical features extracted from tracks across different styles.

`Task:` The primary task is to predict the genres of these unlabeled tracks.

To accomplish this, I employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. By transforming the abundant features
into principal components, I streamline the data, making it more manageable and revealing patterns that are not immediately obvious in the raw data. 
The principal components I’ve derived forms the foundation for the next step in the project—employing a supervised machine learning algorithm,
with a focus on the well-known logistic regression technique.
